# New Challenge — A World Clock App
As much fun as this currency converter web app has been, it’s time to move on!

The currency converter was our first real-world web app. We built it up piece by piece, and now it’s time to start over on a new app which we’ll also build up over a few challenges.

The challenge now is to make a start on a web app for showing the current time in an arbitrary timezone. This initial minimal viable product (as the startup jargon goes) should display a clock showing the current time, and allow the user to control the following:

* The timezone the clock shows the current time in.
* Whether or not the clock shows 12 hour time or 24 hours time.
* Whether or not the clock shows seconds.
* Whether or not the clock shows pulsing dividers between the parts of the time.

Rather than implementing your own timezone conversion, please use either JavaScript’s built-in date functions, or, better yet, an open source library dedicated to making date and time operations easy. I’d recommend using moment.js https://momentjs.com/ with it’s optional timezone extension https://momentjs.com/timezone/.

Instalment 95 will be dedicated to a sample solution to this challenge.
