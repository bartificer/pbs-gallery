> Note that the currency converter API used in these instalments has changed their TOS and their API. They now require an account be created and a security token passed to each AJAX call. They also rate-limit the use of the API, and free accounts can't use some previously available functionality. You will almost certainly need to update your code before submitting it to the gallery.
